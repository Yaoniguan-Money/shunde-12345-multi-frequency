# ADR-001: Deterministic pipeline, bounded LLM
Status: accepted

High-volume processing is deterministic handlers/services. LLM is only used for difficult bounded subproblems.

# ADR-002: Obsidian as source, runtime snapshot as hot path
Status: accepted

Per-mention Obsidian calls are prohibited.

# ADR-003: PostgreSQL + pgvector before separate vector DB

Status: accepted

Human review is not a mandatory gate; correction/audit remains.
